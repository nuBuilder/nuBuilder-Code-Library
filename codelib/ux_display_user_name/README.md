### UX: Display the Logged in User Name

To display the logged in username instead of the nubuilder.com link, set this option in nuconfig.php to true

```javascript
nuUXOptions['nuShowLoggedInUser']= true;
```

This is especially useful if you log in with different users (to test functionality from the user perspective) and want to know with which user you are logged in.
