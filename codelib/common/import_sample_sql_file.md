## Importing an SQL File into nuBuilder

Some snippets contain a sample in the form of an SQL file (DB Dump). This can be imported directly into an existing nuBuilder database.
The dump usually contains a form, its objects and table and sometimes a procedure. No existing data will be overwritten/modified or deleted!

How to import the file:

1. Log into phpMyAdmin (In nuBuilder, go to the tab "Builders" and click on the "Database" button)
2. In phpMyAdmin, Click "Import" in the top menu
3. Under File to Import, click "Browse" and select the sql file to import.
4. Click "Go" at the bottom right to import the database file.
5. When the database has been imported successfully, you should see a message at the top of the page similar to: "Import has been successfully finished".
6. Log out from nuBuilder (if logged in) and  log in again for the changes to take effect.
